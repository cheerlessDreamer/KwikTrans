*I'm a Brit living in Sweden and although I'm comfortable reading Swedish, occasionally a new word or phrase crops up that I can't understand. **Enter KwikTrans!***

Previously, I would manually copy and paste the text into Google Translate, but it always felt cumbersome to fire up a whole browser session just to translate a single word or idiom. KwikTrans takes the contents of the clipboard translates the text much faster than manually using Google Translate! 

As an interesting beginners test for myself, I also implemented a 'Random' function, where you can guess the correct language out of a choice of three, just for fun.
